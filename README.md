# j2assembly

This Readme.md file is just to inform anyone who views this project at a future time as to what this project originally was.

This project was originally made in 48 hours as a part of the QUT Code Network Winter Hackathon 2017 and was based around the idea that Java code is too complex to run on microcontrollers due to them not having a JVM. Without the necessary RAM and JVM underlying, a java program cannot run.
This Project had the simple goal of taking valid Java syntax (Java class files before compilation) and converting them into a equivilant syntax in C++ for compilation by the C++ compiler.

The two files included in the src/example directory are for a PSVM and a file to be compiled.

This project only 90% worked by the end of the hackathon, with most structures being proted successfully but manual edits being required to compile, and since then has been redesigned into a new project that can be found at https://github.com/34638a/Project-Thermos
